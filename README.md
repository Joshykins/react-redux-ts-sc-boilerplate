# react-redux boilerplate
This contains enough to get a project up and running with ease, also contains hot loading for [react](https://github.com/facebook/react). 

## Webpack
If you want to load css, scss etc. you'll need to add the appropriate resolvers yourself, I mainly use [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) now so I haven't added anything but an image resolver. 

## State management 
This boilerpalte uses Redux for it's global state management. Reference the examples to see our pattern for developing with redux. 

## Unit testing
Will add in the near future, along with husky to run tests pre commit or something like that.

## Routing

## Styling
